        <h2>Why Student Housing Matters</h2>
        <p>
            DORMY is a student housing platform designed to provide a seamless and secure
            living experience for students.
        </p>

        <p>
            We simplify the search process by allowing students to explore available rooms
            from anywhere, saving time and effort.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our platform provides accurate information including room photos, facilities,
            pricing, and exact distance from universities.
        </p>

        <p>
            Booking and communication are streamlined, allowing students to book or inquire
            directly without phone calls or physical visits.
        </p>

        <p>
            We focus on safety and comfort, ensuring students feel at home even when they are
            far from their families.
        </p>

        <p>
            By offering everything in one place, DORMY helps students settle quickly and
            confidently into their new city.
